0 G Going through history for statement and found myself reading about one of the many problems my boy had as a baby and wondered if any one here has heard of this Benign Infantile Myoclonus, he was in for a blood test for Jaundice and was asleep and his arms and legs were jerking as they often did when he was asleep, I thought it was like when you jump when we are falling asleep and couldnt understand the fuss as they rushed to give him an EEG. Pead said it is common in Babies and they outgrow it. Wondering now what with ASD being more likely to have Epilepsy.      Tatty x
