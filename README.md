# Thesis
By Joy Ming 

This project pulls posts from medical forums relating to autism spectrum disorder 
and discover collections of co-occuring conditions or characteristics (such as "epilepsy" or "non-verbal").
The objective is to (a) develop a method to mine co-occuring conditions and characteristics
(b) use a clustering approach to see if there are groups among these co-occuring conditions.
This will be compared against patient attributes from clinical data to see whether co-occurrences
in clinical data match co-occurences in popular/lay text.
